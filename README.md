Download and keep steam games up to date on a nas.


Steam nas downlaoder
--------------------

This program is designed to enable the downloading and updating of steam games. I created this because I primarialy use linux at home, but not all games run on windows. When I go to windows to play a game, I thought it would be nice to be able to do that without having to download months worth of updates.

The programme makes use of the steam-cli to downlaod games.


Requirements
============

python
steam-cli
A steam account without 2 factor authentication (If anyone knows a nice way to make this work that would be good to know.)
